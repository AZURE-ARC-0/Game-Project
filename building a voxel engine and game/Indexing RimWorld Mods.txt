- Indexing Old RimWorld Mod List -
Date: Sunday, March 9, 2025
Let's go ahead and index your old RimWorld mod list. Are we working from an existing file you want me to analyze, or are we reconstructing the list from memory and past preferences? If you have specific categories (e.g., QoL, AI, Combat, Storytellers, Factions, etc.), I can structure the index accordingly. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

You said:




Ok here's your first set to ocr from the paper lists we can sort then all after you have them ocr'ed into the context window.

This is just one page broken into multiple photos, there's a few like this.
ChatGPT said:
I'll process the images and extract the text from them. Let me start the OCR process now.

Good work, you seem to have found a OCR workflow process that can process my handwriting, which I know is horrible, but honestly that was the best handwriting I've ever done, especially at such small size.

Now another page, a much more simple one. Off.

Alright, here's a whole bunch that, in particular, for a whole subset, about trying to create a very particular kind of medical system in the game out of mods that were present in the game when I used this mod list probably about five years ago, just at the start of the pandemic and lockdown.

You said:
Right the only for sure error that was an ocr artifact was " 135. Erian's" maybe That was a glitch based off Orion's, which was a comment on the Orion's Hospitality and Old Faction Mod series.
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense! "Erians" was likely an OCR artifact, and it was meant to reference Orion’s mods, particularly Orion’s Hospitality and the Orion’s Faction Mod series.

I'll correct it in the final list under the Horror & Faction Mods category:

Correction to Horror & Faction Mods
Orion’s Hospitality (Faction interaction and guest management mod)
Orion’s Faction Mod Series (Older faction mods that expanded NPC behaviors and settlements)
This fully corrects the only confirmed OCR artifact in the indexed list.

If you spot anything else that might need a fix, just let me know!

Alright, just double-check everything we did in all the past canvases and make sure any corrections I mentioned are obviously carried forward and that this list is as thorough, comprehensive, and detailed as possible.

Alright, now make a thorough, comprehensive, modernized version that includes the entire Vanilla Expanded Mod series, After everything else, don't remove previous old references to it. Just include everything that you're aware of as part of the modern vanilla expanded mod series, as obviously this old mod series is out of date, and there's a bunch of analogies, changes, and things that have to be checked out. But just having the old list is very important. And start a new canvas for this new list. Don't overwrite or work in the old one.
